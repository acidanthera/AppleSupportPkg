## ApfsDriverLoader
Open source apfs.efi loader based on reverse-engineered Apple's ApfsJumpStart driver

- Loads apfs.efi from ApfsContainer located on block device.
- Apfs driver verbose logging suppressed.
- Version system: connects each apfs.efi to the device from which it was retrieved
- Supports AppleLoadImage protocol provides EfiBinary signature check
– **WARNING**: Please load AppleLoadImage.efi right before ApfsDriverLoader, or just put it inside drivers64uefi folder of your Clover bootloader

## AppleLoadImage
Implementation of AppleLoadImage protocol discoverd in ApfsJumpStart Apple driver. This protocol installs in CoreDxe Apple's firmware.

It provides safe EFI binary loading into memory by verifiyng it's signature.

- Also gives ability to use native ApfsJumpStart driver from Apple firmware
- **WARNING**: ApplePartitionDriver needed

## AppleDxeImageVerificationLib
This library provides reverse-engineered Apple's crypto signature algorithms.
